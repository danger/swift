## 1.0.0

It's time, Danger Swift now has enough to be useful to nearly everyone and is in use in production environments today.

As of 1.0.0, Danger Swift is fully documented at https://danger.systems/swift and sits as a peer with Ruby and
JavaScript. Most of the documentation lives here in this repo, and the reference is auto-generated.

It's been over a year of work, so I'm (orta) really glad to see this get out and be a first-class citizen for the iOS
community.

There are still some big upcoming features planned:

- A revised version of the plugin system ([#139][139])
- A synchronous GitHub API client ([#99][99])

- [@orta][] and [@f-meloni][]

This release also includes:

- Improve invalid DSL error message [@f-meloni][]
- Fail if danger-js version is below the minimum supported version by [@f-meloni][]
- Add method to get all the lines that contain a word on a file by [@f-meloni][]

## 0.8.1

- Fix danger report system by [@f-meloni][]
- More docs by [@orta][]
- Fixes for people installing via homebrew (thanks [@f-meloni][]) by [@orta][]

## 0.8.0

- Whoah! The SwiftLint plugin has been merged into Danger by [@orta][]

  This is not my work, really, it's the work of the contributors to the Danger SwiftLint plugin (which, yes, I am a
  contributor, so...) - but it's mainly the work of [@ashfurrow][] [@sunshinejr][] [@Killectro][] and [@thii][].

  This is discussed in https://github.com/ashfurrow/danger-swiftlint/issues/17 where I pitched that maybe we should just
  inline this dependency because so many people are going to use this. The Swift community is likely the only community
  using Danger Swift, so why not make this version have a bit more focus on what people are doing with it?

- Docs, lots of lots of docs by [@orta][]

  This is a blocker on 1.0ing Danger Swift. So, we're getting there now.

- Internal faffing, and splitting of some test-related code so that Plugins can have an elegant test API by [@orta][]

  This revises the way in which you can write tests in Danger plugins. Should be much easier now.

- Adds some utils functions for doing one-off commands in the terminal by [@orta][]

  `danger.utils.exec` will return the string of the STDOUT outputted by that command, use this for things you're sure
  aren't going to fail.

  `danger.utils.spawn` is a throwable version of the above which includes all the essential error information if the
  command fails.

## 0.3.0

- Supports the command: `danger-swift edit` to generate an Xcodeproj which you can edit your Dangerfile in - [@orta][]
- Adds plugin infrastructure to `danger-swift` - [@orta][]

  There aren't any plugins yet, but there is infrastructure for them. By suffixing `package: [url]` to any import, you
  can directly import Swift PM package as a dependency, which is basically how plugins will work.

  ```swift
  import SwiftLint // package: https://github.com/danger/DangerSwiftLint.git

  SwiftLint.lint(danger)
  ```
